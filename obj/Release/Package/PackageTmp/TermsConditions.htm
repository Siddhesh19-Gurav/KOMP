               PLEASE READ KITCHEN ON MY PLATE's (Hence known as KOMP's) TERMS & CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE BROWSING OR REGISTERING ON THE WEBSITE OR USING ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES OFFERED. THE USE OF THE KOMP WEBSTE WILL INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF OUR T & C AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO ABIDE BY THE SAME.

               <ul>
               <li>Currently, KOMP's Dinner Service is available only in Kandivali (East), Malad (East) and Goregaon (East) but other areas are coming soon. Our lunch service, through Dabbawalas is available for Central, Western and Harbour line. </li>
               <li>You could either book a meal plan for 10 days, which would be valid for 15 calendar days, after which you have to rebook for continuance. Or you could book a meal plan for 22 days, which is valid for 45 calendar days.</li>
               <li>If KOMP service gets disrupted or has to be stopped for any unforeseen reason, such as riots, earthquake  (Force majeure) or any other natural or man-made calamity, or the Dabbawalas decide to go on a flash strike, we would not assure responsibility for the inconvenience caused to you. KOMP staff will however try to inform you in advance, and your delivery would be resumed as soon as conditions stabilize or are normal.</li>
               <li>Dabbawalas Lunch service will not available one week in April every year. </li>
               <li>KOMP prices for the Tiffin Service do not include delivery charges as applicable to Dabbawalas delivery service. Dabbawalas delivery charges as applicable are Rs 250/- for 10 days meal & Rs 500 for 22 days meal service which are not inclusive of KOMP prices for the Tiffin Service. </li>
               <li>KOMP does not allow swapping meals between lunch and dinner due to logistical reasons</li>
               <li>You are free to choose vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals at the same time under KOMP's  Customised Tiffin service plan.</li>
               <li>Your meal plan starts only after we receive your payment. </li>
               <li>You can pause your Lunch/ Dinner meal service for a given day(s) by sending us a SMS message before 1 pm the previous day. So if you plan to pause a meal let’s say on 6th April then we should receive the “Pause a Meal” notification via SMS before 1 pm 5th April for us to successfully pause your meal the next day. Number of Meals paused during the “Pause a Meal” period to be consumed within the validity period of that meal plan. Post the validity period the Paused Meals if not consumed will expire.  This is the reason we give 15 calendar days for 10 days meal and 45 calendar days for 22 days meal so you have the flexibility to consume your meals within these days.</li>
               <li>You can get your lunch delivered at office and dinner at home only if your office and home address are covered in our delivery areas.</li>
               <li>The meal is packed in disposable and microwavable containers and is delivered in a hygienic Disposable Paper bag. But if you find the Tiffin tampered with, please do inform us and we will look into the issue and revert to you at the earliest. </li>
               <li>Once you receive the meal it needs to be heated again for around 30 secs. We don’t assure that KOMP food would be 100% hot.</li>
                <li>Although we assure tasty, home-style meals, the definition of "tasty" can vary from person to person, and KOMP assumes no liability for this variance.   </li>
                <li>For KOMP service, there is no security deposit to be paid in advance.</li>
                <li>You can place your order online on our website www.kitchenonmyplate.com or request by email, SMS or calling us.</li>
                <li>We assure you that our meals are Healthy, Hygienic, Nutritious, Fresh and Tasty. However, if an ingredient or two is non-available, KOMP may have to use substitute ingredients and assumes no liability of the changed flavour or taste of your meal. </li>
                <li>We spare a lot of time and effort on our meal planning to offer you maximum variety under each plan, every month.

KOMP will however try, if possible and give you a prior intimation of the change.  </li>

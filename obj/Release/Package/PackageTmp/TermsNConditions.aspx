               <li>Our lunch & dinner meals get delivered in Western Line, Central Line & Harbour Line. We cover almost all areas in Mumbai, still to confirm whether your delivery location falls in our delivery service area, you can simply check it on kitchenonmyplate.com.</li>
               <li>You could either book a meal plan for 10 days, which will be valid for 15 working days, after which you have to re-book for continuance. Or you could book a meal plan for 22 days, which is valid for 35 working days. We also have 2 days trial meal plan.</li>
               <li>If KOMP service gets disrupted or has to be stopped for any unforeseen reason, such as riots, earthquake (force majeure) or any other natural or man-made calamity, or the Third party delivery service decides to go on a flash strike, we will not take responsibility for the inconvenience caused to you. KOMP staff will however try to inform you in advance, and your delivery will be resumed as soon as conditions stabilize or are normal.</li>
               <li>KOMP prices for the Tiffin Service do not include delivery charges as applicable to delivery service. Separate delivery charges as applicable, are Rs. 75/- for 2 days trial meal, Rs. 300/- for 10 day meal & Rs. 600/- for 22 day meal service.</li>
               <li>KOMP does not allow swapping meals between lunch and dinner due to logistical reasons.</li>
               <li>You are free to choose Veg and Non-Veg meals at the same time under KOMP's ‘Customised Tiffin Service’ plan for our Lunch tiffin service.</li>
               <li>Your meal plan starts only after we receive your payment. KOMP to receive the payment for meal orders by12 pm at least a day before to your meal start date. The meal delivery for any payment received after 12 pm will start a day later.</li>
               <li>Yes, you may pause your Lunch/ Dinner meal service for a given day(s) by sending us SMS before 1:00 PM the previous day. So if you plan to pause a meal let’s say on 6th of April then we should receive the “Pause a Meal” notification via SMS before 1:00 PM, 5th of April for us to successfully pause your meal the next day. <br /><br />
                Number of Meals paused during the “Pause a Meal” still to be consumed within the validity period of that meal plan. Once the validity period is over the Paused Meals if not consumed till then will expire.  This is the reason we give 15 working days for 10 day meal and 35 working days for 22 day meal so you have the flexibility to consume your meals within these days.</li>
               <li>You can get your lunch delivered at the office and dinner at home only if your office and home address are covered in our delivery areas.</li>
               <li>The meal is packed in disposable and microwavable containers and is delivered in a hygienic Disposable Paper bag. But if you find the Tiffin tampered with or in open state, please do not consume the tiffin content and inform us immediately and we will look into the issue and revert to you at the earliest.</li>
               <li>Once you receive the meal, it needs to be heated again. We don’t assure that KOMP food will be 100% warm. Our microwaveable containers can be heated for around 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
               <li>Although we assure tasty, home-style meals, the definition of "tasty" can vary from person to person, and KOMP assumes no liability for this variance.</li>
                <li>For KOMP service, there is no security deposit to be paid in advance.</li>
